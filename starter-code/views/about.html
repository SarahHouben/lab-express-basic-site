                <h3>The Kiwi</h3>
                <h4>Everyone's favourite</h4>
                <p>Kiwis are native birds of New Zealand, comprising of 5 species of birds belonging to the genus
                    Apteryx. Kiwis are the smallest among the ratites, a group of flightless birds including the
                    ostriches, emus, and other birds. Kiwis are so closely associated with the culture of New Zealand
                    that the citizens of the country are often called Kiwis. 5 species of kiwis are found of which one
                    is critically endangered, one is endangered and two are vulnerable, as per the IUCN Classification
                    of these birds.</p>

                <h3>The Kakapo</h3>
                <h4>The clever one</h4>
                <p>The kakapo, a unique species of flightless parrot, is endemic to New Zealand and is almost on the
                    verge of extinction, classified as critically endangered by the IUCN. The fact that kakapos are
                    nocturnal in nature, flightless and do not exhibit any male parental care, makes them different from
                    other parrots of the world. They are also the heaviest among the parrots and exhibit the lek system
                    of mating. For years these birds have been hunted by the Maori tribes of New Zealand for meat and
                    feathers. The sweet musky odor emanated from these birds had led to their doom as the odor easily
                    gave away their locations in the forests. Today, with only a few individuals remaining, they are
                    heavily protected by the New Zealand government against poaching.</p>

                <h3>The Tahake</h3>
                <h4>The one no one has heard of</h4>
                <p>The Tahake was considered to be extinct before it was rediscovered in 1948. Since then, the bird has
                    been provided protection by the New Zealand Government and populations of this bird have been
                    relocated to some predator-free islands in the country to allow their population to recover. As of
                    yet, the IUCN classifies these birds as endangered. The introduction of non-native species to the
                    country, extensive poaching, and habitat destruction have been the three primary factors responsible
                    for the decrease of Tahake numbers in the wild.</p>

                <h3>The Weka</h3>
                <h4>The one that is NOT a kiwi (come on, they don't look that similar)</h4>
                <p>Wekas are around the size of a common domestic chicken. Four subspecies of wekas are known to exist
                    and these birds feed on both plant parts as well as invertebrates. Wekas are currently classified as
                    vulnerable by the IUCN. These birds are prey of dogs, cats and ferrets while stoats and rats are
                    also known to prey on chicks and eggs of wekas, respectively. Intense competition with other animals
                    in its habitat also decreases the weka population.</p>
